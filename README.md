Mostly to have a repo to show how to do commit-based trigger.

Inspired from https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/4935 and scikit-learn
code e.g.
[check_build_trigger.sh](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/build_tools/github/check_build_trigger.sh)
and
[wheels workflow](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/.github/workflows/wheels.yml).

See it in action here https://github.com/lesteve/gha-commit-trigger/pull/1
